- New Feature: Ui Elements
  - What it does: Allows the user to interact with the program by receiving messages from the program, triggered by
    their inputs.
- New Feature: Duplication checker
  - What it does: Makes sure that duplicate entries by the user are not added into the list
  - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as a user can mistakenly add the same company twice
    and the program provides a convenient way to be informed of the duplication mistake
  - Highlights: This feature was used in other program features as well, such as the `add samples` where the duplication
    checker is used to check if samples have already been added by the user
