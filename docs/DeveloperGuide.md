Fig 2: Shows the class Event that holds event details and the company list.

### Ui 

Ui class involves all the methods that display messages to the user when the user is interacting with the program.

Types of methods:

1. Greeting Messages: Messages shown to welcome user and acknowledge their exit
2. Confirmation Messages: Messages shown to inform user that their desired action has been carried out
3. Exception Messages: Messages shown to inform user of their invalid actions and its reasons

### Storage


<code>sequence diagram</code>

### Parser

Parser involves dealing with parsing user input to understand what the user wants to do. It returns a 
<code>Command</code> class that it executed during the run-time.

### Command
Command classes are executed after the parser class has processed the user input. The figure below shows a typical class 
diagram, AddCommand, which inherits from Command.

![AddCommand_Class.png](UML%2FImage%2FAddCommand_Class.png)


We also have an example of a sequence diagram for the AddCommand as shown in the figure below.

![AddCommand.png](UML%2FImage%2FAddCommand.png)

The following <code>Command</code> classes inherits from the main <code>Command</code> class and 
executes different code.


#### Add Command
Every implementation of the `add` command is created with 4 instances of user input, the strings 
<code>companyName</code>, <code>contactEmail</code>, <code>industry</code> and integer <code>contactNumber</code>.
AddCommand will add the Company class to CompanyList through the <code>CompanyList.add(Company)</code> and
the CompanyList will be updated through CompanyListEncoder through <code>CompanyListEncoder.write(CompanyList)</code>.

#### Choose Venue Command
Every implementation of `ChooseVenueCommand` creates and stores an integer <code>venueNum</code>. It will then
run `execute` where venue chosen will be updated via <code>event.updateVenue(venueList, venueNum)</code> and
updates the chosen venue in the storage files through <code>EventDetailsStorage.updateFile(event, venueNum)</code>.

#### Confirm Command
Every implementation of `ConfirmCommand` creates and store an integer <code>companyNum</code> which is the
specific company to be marked confirmed in the CompanyList. It will then run `execute` which will mark a company as
confirmed through <code>companyList.markConfirm(companyNum)</code> and <code>CompanyListEncoder.write(companyList)</code>.

#### Unconfirm Command
Every implementation of `UnconfirmCommand` creates and store an integer <code>companyNum</code> which is the
specific company to be marked unconfirmed in the CompanyList. It will then run `execute` which will mark a company as
unconfirmed through <code>companyList.markUnconfirm(companyNum)</code> and <code>CompanyListEncoder.write(companyList)</code>.

#### Delete Command
Every implementation of `DeleteCommand` creates and store an integer <code>taaskNum</code> which is the
specific company to be deleted in the CompanyList. It will then run `execute` which will delete a company from the companyList
through <code>companyList.deleteCompanyInformation(taskNum)</code> and <code>CompanyListEncoder.write(companyList)</code>.

#### Find Company Command
Every implementation of `FindCompanyCommand` creates and store a String <code>targetCompany</code> which is the
specific company to be found in the CompanyList. It will then run `execute` which will find a company from the companyList
through <code>companyList.findCompany(targetCompany)</code>.

#### Find Industry Command
Every implementation of `FindIndustryCommand` creates and store a String <code>targetIndustry</code> which is the
specific company to be found in the CompanyList. It will then run `execute` which will find companies from a specific 
industry from the companyList through <code>companyList.findIndustry(targetIndustry)</code>.

#### List Company Command
Every implementation of `ListCompanyCommand` shows all the companies currently stored in the CompanyList. It will then run 
`execute` which will print out each company through <code>companyList.printCompanyInformation()</code>.

#### List Company Command
Every implementation of `ListUnconfirmedCommand` shows all the unconfirmed companies currently stored in the CompanyList.
It will then run `execute` which will print out each unconfirmed company through <code>companyList.printUnconfirmed()</code>.

#### List Venue Command
Every implementation of `ListVenueCommand` shows all the venues currently stored in the venueList.
It will then run `execute` which will print out each venue through <code>venueList.printVenueInformation()</code>.

#### Load Sample Company Command
Every implementation of `LoadSampleCompanyCommand` loads all the sample company list for user testing and updates it into
the file. It will then run `execute` which will load the samples into companyList and the save file through
<code>companyList.loadSampleCompanyInformation()</code> and <code>CompanyListEncoder.write(companyList)</code>.

#### Purge Command
Every implementation of `PurgeCompanyCommand` deletes the information of companies already stored in the companyList. 
It will then run `execute` which will delete each company in the companyList through <code>companyList.purgeData()</code>
and <code>CompanyListEncoder.write(companyList)</code>.

#### Update Event Name Command
Every implementation of `UpdateEventNameCommand` creates a new string <code>newEventName</code> which stores the new name
for the Event. It will then run `execute` which will update the Event name through <code>event.updateEventName(newEventName)</code>.
A new integer, <code>venueIndex</code>, is created and stored with the return value of <code>event.getVenue().getVenueIndex()</code>.
Lastly, the file within storage is updated through <code>EventDetailsStorage.updateFile(event, venueIndex)</code>.


### Features

#### Duplication checker feature

The <code>duplicationChecker</code> is facilitated by <code>CompanyList</code>. It will check against the existing
<code>CompanyList</code> to check if the company has already been added. The check is done in 3 ways: `company name`,
`contact number`, and `contact email`. If any one of the above-mentioned details are identical to the ones already present
in the <code>CompanyList</code>, it will inform the user by displaying a message to the user. Otherwise, it will proceed to 
format the data that was entered by the user so that the parameters that are passed into <code>addCommand</code> are
standardized to remove any potential duplicated addition issues.

Fig 5: Shows the sequence diagram for when `showWelcome` is called by `EveNtUS` during the startup of the application.

####  Add feature
The adding to company list feature  is facilitated by <code>AddCommand</code>. It will add new <code>Company</code> to existing 
list of companies. It has four parameters, <code>companyName</code>, <code>industry</code>, <code>contactNumber</code>, and <code>contactEmail</code>. 
After successfully executing the command, it will show successful addition message using
the related method in the <code>Ui</code>.

####  Delete feature
The deleting company feature  is facilitated by <code>DeleteCommand</code>. It will delete the company at the specified 
index in the list of companies. After successfully executing the command,
it will show successful deletion message using the related method in the <code>Ui</code>.

#### List companies feature
The listing company feature  is facilitated by <code>ListCompanyCommand</code>. It will print out the companies
in the list of companies.
The Company object is then printed out with
an integer denoting its index, and four parameters, <code>companyName</code>, <code>industry</code>,
<code>contactNumber</code>, and <code>contactEmail </code>, and its confirmation status.

####  Store/Load Company information to text file feature
The Storing company list feature will allow the user to save the information of companies to disk. A text file will be
created to store all the company information the user wishes to save. This text file will be overwritten everytime the
user makes changes to the stored information. 

When relaunching EventUS, the program will check if there is a text file which contains the information of previously 
saved companies. If the text file exists, the information of the companies
stored will be parsed and added to a local ArrayList. If the text file does not exist, it is created.

![Encoder.png](UML%2FImage%2FEncoder.png)

Fig 6: Shows how the <code>CompanyListEncoder</code> deals with saving the data to the text file.

![Decoder.png](UML%2FImage%2FDecoder.png)

Fig 7: Shows how the <code>CompanyListDecoder</code> deals with copying the data from the text file.

####  Storing event details feature
The eventDetailStorage feature will allow users to save the event details of the current session to hard disk.
A text file will be created to store information such as event name and venue information. This text file will be
overwritten everytime the user makes changes to the stored information, such as renaming the event name or changing the
venue of the event. When relaunching EventUS, the program will check if there is a text file which contains the
information of an event. If the text file exists, the information of the Event instance will be updated with the event
details. If there is no text file, a text file will be created.

![chooseVenueCommand.png](UML%2FImage%2FchooseVenueCommand.png)

Fig 8: Shows how the <code>ChooseVenueCommand</code> updates the venue in the <code>Event</code> class and updates
the text file through <code>EventDetailsStorage</code>
